# Web-One Easy Steps WordPress Theme

This theme supports the Advanced Custom Fields Pro implementation of CSUN Easy Steps. [Refer to the Advanced Custom Fields Pro documentation](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/) for more information on how to use that plugin.

Customizations occur in ```/page-eblast-X``` where X is the template name.

Custom Fields can be exported as JSON using the exporter tool in the WordPress dashboard. Alternatively, you can add the fields directly to ```functions.php``` and then not have to export. See ```register-fields-php.md``` in the theme root.
